## 📝 Pipeline
In the pursuit of Overall Nighttime Visibility Enhancement, our pipeline consists of a glow suppression module *LBDN* and a progressive enhancement module *GRE* with 3 stages. This proposed pipeline is
based on zero-shot learning without any training data. The glow is first decomposed to obtain in *LBDN* and refined with an *APSF* generator. Then the
obtained transmission *D* is fed into *GRE* for illumination enhancement via Retinex Enhancement modules *REM*, guided by the grayscaled glow map *GM*.

## 🗂️ Datasets
Our method is **training-free** (no separate training phase required). The testing is performed directly on:
- [Light-effects Dataset](https://github.com/jinyeying/night-enhancement)
- [Flare7K Dataset](https://github.com/ykdai/Flare7K)

## 🛠️ Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---

## 🚀 Training & Testing

### Two-step Execution:

#### 1. Generate illumination hints:
```bash
python Segment.py
```

#### 2. Perform glow removal and brightness enhancement:
```bash
python Deglow.py
```
#### Key Notes:
1. We added TV loss to reduce checkerboard artifacts in glow maps, which differs from the loss setting in the paper.

2. Two adjustable parameters:

- *gamma: controls brightness enhancement intensity*

- *weight: controls the glow separation degree*
